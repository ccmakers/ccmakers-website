Marc Sitkin and I talked to admins at the Harwich Cultural Center today and found a place to store the sewing machine pullouts that were removed. The cubby holes will store the computers, freeing up table space.

I brought some gusset plates in from a failed project and sturdied up a table.

Marc is 3-D printing some plastic knobs for adjusting clamping on hold down clamps. The files are assumed to be the correct, so we tested a layer print just to be sure.

Working on a test print to calibrate 3-d printers.

Printed test print.
