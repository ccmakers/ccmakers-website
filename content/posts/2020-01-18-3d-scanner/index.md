### ***Get Ready to Scan!***
 Cape Cod Makers is happy to announce that we have received a grant towards a 3D scanner called the Structure Sensor. This will allow us to scan objects and people, to perform a 3D room capture, and to experiment with 3D perception. These scans can be used digitally or to create real-world objects with a 3D printer and CNC machine.  We are looking forward to making this tool available to the local community through our makerspace at the Harwich Cultural Center.  We'd like to extend a big thank you to the Harwich Culture Council for supporting Cape Cod Makers. This program is supported in part by a grant from the Harwich Culture Council, a local agency which is supported by the Massachusetts Cultural Council, a state agency.
